# phpremix
a simple php framework that combines the power of existing frameworks in one elegant place

# why 
I like simplicity, so i merged the simplicity of `Slim Framework` with the power of `Laravel` components and `Composer` community . 

# installation
1)- `git clone https://github.com/alash3al/phpremix.git`  
2)- `cd phpremix`  
3)- start coding !  

# directory overview
1)- `lib`: contains all your custom libraries e.g `models, ... etc` it follows the composer standards .  
2)- `routes`: contains all your routes files .  
3)- `vendor`: is the composer directory for installing new packages .  
4)- `views`: is the directory that contains the views of your projects .  
5)- `settings.php`: this file contains a global settings for use with Slim and laravel Capsule "the database manager" .  

# wiki 
There is no wiki !!, just goto `Slim Framework` wiki and `Laravel\Capsule` package wiki ;) .
